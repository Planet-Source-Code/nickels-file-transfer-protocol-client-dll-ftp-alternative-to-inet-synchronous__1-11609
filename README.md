## File Transfer Protocol Client DLL \(FTP\) \(Alternative to Inet\) \(Synchronous\)


</div>

### Description

A small 56KB DLL that has a FTPClient.Connection Object that allows you to perform FTP client control capabilities from your applications. ChangeDirectory, MakeDirectory, Rename, RemoveFile, RemoveDirectory, ListContents, GetFile and PutFile. Source code for the DLL and examples for both VB and ASP are included. Yeah, the Inet control lets you do the same, but after finding 6 or 7 FIX documents on MSDN and unsuccessfuly being able to upload 90 files in a row, I descieded to make this DLL. It successfuly uploaded all 90 files in a flash. If you do find problems submit them here http://www.neotextsoftware.com
